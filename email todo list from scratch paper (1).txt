Plans: build more of my Tiny
House with that bunch of wood
I saw by the wood store
out for free to take, later
before I get home. Should I find more wood, maybe not.

short story
continued

  The person in that house(crossed out text) house 
from a long time ago seemed like
they belonged there ever since the
big man left. The snow felt good
and the sky felt good too.
  There were so many apples and
plums and oranges on that table
that he could hardly count what
that could be worth to him later.
  Maybe some things were easy
to reckon about him, but maybe
someone wouldn't try it as easily
as it looked.

short story

  The wind of October was
memorable to the person at
the lake beach. However, it
was snowing so they weren't
sure how to cope with it.
  They made tea, they made coffee,
they even made noodles. There
were friends in the beach house
and there was light music playing.
  The music was so beautiful
that he couldn't wonder where
else he should be today.
  He remembered the clouds and
he remembered the teddy bear
that Johnny, had had once before
and how much it meant to him
a little while ago.
