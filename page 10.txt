Short story
Continued

  One of the people at the picnic had a cool
 guitar and shared with Johnny’s friend stories 
of when he bought it years ago and why it meant 
so much to him. Johnny tried to play it and it 
sounded pretty good.
Johnny’s friend tried to play it too and that 
sounded really cool too.
  They all opened more chips and soda and then 
left for the night to go pick up some fast food 
and watch TV.
