The wind of October was
 memorable to the person at
the lake beach. However, it
was snowing so they werent
sure how to cope with it.
  They made tea, they made coffee, 
they even made noodles. There 
were friends in the beach house
and there was light music playing.
  The music was so beautiful
that he couldn't wonder where
else he should be today.
  He remembered the clouds and
he remembered the teddy bear
that Johnny had had once before
and how much it meant to him
a little while ago.
