Short story
Continued
  The friend of Johnny was playing video games and Johnny was watching TV. The lady was folding
clothes and humming things.
  Across the room was a window with bright sunshine. Far from the house was a man playing
with an umbrella dance and play in the distance.
  “How was your day today Johnny. I haven’t talked to you a while. And this game is pretty fun by
the way.” Said the friend.
  “It was pretty good. How was yours? I’m not sure I’ve seen this show too.” Said Johnny.
  They spoke of these types of things for maybe twenty minutes and watched TV.
  The lady went upstairs.
  …
  There was singing and bad music playing for a little while before Johnny awoke with his friend
in a hazy and tired pile of blankets. The lady must have been practicing music sheets again.
  Johnny and his friend decided to go to the mall to play more outside.
