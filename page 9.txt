Johnny and the Mountain Village
Short story
Continued


The bench by the park far from the mall was bleak 
and lightly shadowed by a tree lit by a bright 
breezy day. There were flowers and dandelions 
all over the ground and grass and there were 
people having a beautiful picnic in the distance.
  There were some people hanging out with chips 
and soda and there were some people kicking a 
hacky sack and playing the guitar. There were 
even some people listening to music. Most of 
them were very peaceful though and enjoying the 
picnic.
  Johnny and his friend got back from the mall
 and were pretty much in a hurry to sit at the bench
and enjoy the breeze and sunshine of that day.
  â€¦
  They were talking for hours by the time they 
realized it had become dark because of the evening. 
So they gathered their things and joined the people 
at the picnic. They ate there and they shared tales 
of
what they learned at the mall and they all laughed 
and had a good time before the day was over.
