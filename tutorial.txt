EmptyWorkflowSystem (for) (.applet shortcut)
(consitent, empty txt file process, bg process,
workflow)
(ai, loading bar)
(might be good enough)

(otherwise you have to make a j compiler
for a long ass time still like
a donation computer c compiler to exe)

Maybe you should care less about the empty
ai bg process workflow so you can finish
the j compiler more quickly, or more
easily. Thank you! Have a good day!

Maybe it's good enough for me then, what I made
and what I plan on making for this.
Cool.
Have a great day!
