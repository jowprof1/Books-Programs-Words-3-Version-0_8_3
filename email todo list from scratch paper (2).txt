short story
continued

page 4:
There was a storm at Johnny's friend's
house, but he wasn't there so
the sky was blue. The person of
interest that told him this was
from a cell phone the other day.
   The forest was rough and crisp,
Johnny's friend lived over the bridge
by the store. The bridge
was forgiving to walk a across but
the park by it was always empty
and not very fun.
  When Johnny got to the friend's
house he saw that the room
was pretty but the lady was nice.
