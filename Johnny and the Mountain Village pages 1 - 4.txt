Johnny and the Mountain Village
Short Story
Pages 1 - 3

The clouds where fluffy.
Johnny had a teddy bear and the mountains had people living there. It was a tiny village with brightly happy faces of people from by the river cities.
There wasnt much to be discussed amongst the people other than the news of a big man that was jeoperdizing the peace of the night time neighborhood.

The person in that house from a long time ago seemed like
they belonged there ever since the big man left. The snow felt good
and the sky felt good too.
  There were so many apples and plums and oranges on that table
that he could hardly count what that could be worth to him later.
  Maybe some things were easy to reckon about him, but maybe
someone wouldn't try it as easily as it looked.

The wind of October was
 memorable to the person at
the lake beach. However, it
was snowing so they werent
sure how to cope with it.
  They made tea, they made coffee, 
they even made noodles. There 
were friends in the beach house
and there was light music playing.
  The music was so beautiful
that he couldn't wonder where
else he should be today.
  He remembered the clouds and
he remembered the teddy bear
that Johnny had had once before
and how much it meant to him
a little while ago.

  There was a storm at Johnny's friend's
house, but he wasn't there so
the sky was blue. The person of
interest that told him this was
from a cell phone the other day.
  The forest was rough and crisp,
Johnny's friend lived over the bridge
by the store. The bridge
was forgiving to walk across but
the park by it was always empty
and not very fun.
  When Johnny got to the friend's
house he saw that the room
was pretty but the lady was nice.
