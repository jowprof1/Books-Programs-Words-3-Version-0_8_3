README 2:
have fun making that game
with just txt files and linux, mac, or windows!

by using an auxillary util window or game window from
the system files

and

by using txt files and scripts

and

by using an aux script slot 1 folder in the util window

and 

by

using meaning scripts
and data page meaning scripts
and guitar and music files
and linker script
to attribute scripts and meaning scripts to guitar and music files
to make it mean something like ai to the game player
to make a complete game and engine out of txt files and guitar and music files!

have fun!
