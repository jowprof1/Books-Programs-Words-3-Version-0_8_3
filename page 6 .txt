  The nice lady welcomed Johnny
inside closer to the couch and the
kitchen where Johnny's friend was
making smores with the oven.
  There were pretty pictures on the
walls of giers and caves and
parties.
  The lady's phone rang across the
room and the noise it made reminded
Johnny of Mozart.
