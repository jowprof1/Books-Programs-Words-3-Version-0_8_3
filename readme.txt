run linereader_jd_bytecode_script.txt
which runs it from main.j, temp_script_1, temp_script_2, temp_script_3, script_x...

which runs each token number
which is the same thing as the jd script lines in order interpreted as cmd token strings, as numbers like a calculator
application script

Have fun!
