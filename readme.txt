done! (check mark picture)
have fun making your games and script lists in the aux script slot 1 - 3
using txt files and paint and windows media player for a loading bar with aux script slots!

have fun!
the media player works as visual loading bar for the aux scripts so
you can link the too as a bg process visually
while your writing lists of visual basic scripts
and eventually youll have a full game engine
and fun bunch of games and guitar and music
just by making it like this like linux and ubuntu
like sdl2.

And eventually youll have your own complete
txt loading bar just by assembling the whole
game and engine later.

have fun!
have a good weekend!
