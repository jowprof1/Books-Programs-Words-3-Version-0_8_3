  The room in his house wasn't that dusty but it had
some dirt but not much. The air was fresh but
it was a very old house but not really,
it actually wasn't from that long ago but
it still mattered somewhat.
  The TV was very soothing because it was
so windy the other day. There were pretty people
on the TV and there were ugly people on TV and some
of them seemed pretty smart.
