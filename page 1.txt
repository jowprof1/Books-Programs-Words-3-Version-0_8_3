short story
The clouds where fluffy.
Johnny had a teddy bear and the mountains had people 
living there. It was a tiny village with brightly
 happy faces of people from by the river cities.
There wasnt much to be discussed amongst the
 people other than the news of a big man that 
was jeoperdizing the peace of the night time 
neighborhood.
